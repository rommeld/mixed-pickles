## Project Abstract

Mixed Pickles is a git commit message linter written in Rust with Python bindings via PyO3/Maturin. It validates commit messages against best practices (WIP markers, imperative mood, vague language, issue references, conventional commits) and provides actionable suggestions. The tool runs as a CLI binary or Python library, supports configuration via `pyproject.toml` or `.mixed-pickles.toml`, and integrates with pre-commit hooks and CI/CD pipelines.

## Rust Pattern

- **Leverage the type system for correctness**: Use enums for state machines where variants are mutually exclusive. Use the newtype pattern (struct Miles(f64)) to enforce semantic distinctions at compile time. Prefer typestate patterns to make invalid states unrepresentable—methods only exist on valid state types.
- **Design traits intentionally**: Use associated types when there's one natural implementation per type; use generics when multiple implementations make sense. Keep traits object-safe when `dyn Trait` flexibility is needed (no -> Self returns, no generic methods).
- **Avoid bare** `unwrap()`: Prefer `expect("reason") to document assumptions if behavior is predictable. Use combinators like `unwrap_or_default()`, `unwrap_or_else(|| ...)`, `or ok_or_else(|| ...)` for recoverable cases. Reserve unwrap() for tests.
- **Prefer zero-cost abstractions**: Use iterator chains over manual loops—they compile to equivalent code with better optimization opportunities. Newtypes have no runtime overhead. Generics with trait bounds use static dispatch; reach for `dyn Trait` only when dynamic dispatch is genuinely needed.
- **Treat tests and docs as first-class**: Place unit tests in #[cfg(test)] modules alongside code. Write doc-tests in /// comments to keep examples synchronized. Document # Panics, # Errors, and # Safety sections where applicable.
- **Handle errors explicitly**: Use _thiserror_ for library crates (callers need to match variants) and _anyhow_ for binaries (errors are reported, not matched). Propagate with `?` and add context via `.context()` or `.with_context()`.
- **Prefer** `crate::` **over** `super::`: Use absolute paths from the crate root for clarity and easier refactoring.
- **Use** `pub use` **sparingly**: Reserve re-exports for exposing dependencies so downstream consumers don't need direct dependencies—avoid it for internal module organization.
- **Avoid global state**: Skip `lazy_static!`, `OnceCell`, or similar patterns; prefer passing explicit context for shared state to keep dependencies visible and testing straightforward.
- **Keep dependencies current**: Regularly update to the newest crate versions to benefit from bug fixes, performance improvements, and security patches.
- **Use `LazyLock` for static regexes**: Define regex patterns as `static PATTERN: LazyLock<Regex>` to compile once on first access. Use `.expect("reason")` in the initializer since pattern validity is known at write time.
- **Return `Option<T>` from validation checks**: Prefer returning `Option<Finding>` over booleans—callers use `if let Some(f) = check(...) { findings.push(f) }` to collect results cleanly.
- **Fluent builders with `#[must_use]`**: Configuration structs use `fn field(mut self, value: T) -> Self` methods marked `#[must_use]` to enable chaining while signaling that ignoring the return is likely a bug.
- **Layer configuration explicitly**: Apply settings in order—defaults first, then file config via `apply_file_config()`, then CLI overrides via `apply_cli_overrides()`. Each layer mutates a single config object.
- **Convert errors at FFI boundaries**: When exposing Rust functions to Python via _PyO3_, convert `Result<T, E>` to `PyResult<T>` using `.map_err(|e| PyErr::new::<PyRuntimeError, _>(e.to_string()))` at the boundary.
- **Implement `FromStr` for enums**: Allow parsing strings to enum variants with descriptive error messages listing valid options. Use aliases (e.g., "ref" for `MissingReference`) to improve CLI ergonomics.
- **Borrow with explicit lifetimes for zero-copy**: When pairing results with source data, use lifetime parameters like `ValidationResult<'a>` holding `&'a Commit` to avoid cloning while keeping the borrow checker happy.
